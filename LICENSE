(f) "Unmodified Derivatives" means substances created by the Principal Investigator or Licensee which constitute an unmodified functional subunit or product expressed by the DNA Sequences. Some examples include: subclones of unmodified cell lines, purified or fractionated subsets of the DNA Sequences, proteins expressed by DNA/RNA supplied by the Licensor, or monoclonal antibodies secreted by a hybridoma cell line.

(g) "Modifications" means substances created by the Principal Investigator or Licensee which contain/incorporate the DNA Sequences.

(h) Effective Date: The date of acceptance of this Agreement by the individual accessing/downloading the DNA Sequences.

2. License Grant.
